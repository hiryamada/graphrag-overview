# GraphRAG Accelerator (GraphRAG solution accelerator)

https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-accelerator

A repository that contains Python scripts / Bicep files to deploy the resources required to run GraphRAG on Azure, and execution code in notebook format.

This accelerator builds on top of the graphrag python package and exposes API endpoints hosted on Azure, which can be used to trigger indexing pipelines and enable querying of the graphrag knowledge graph.

Once deployment is complete, you can use a [Python notebook](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-accelerator/blob/main/notebooks/1-Quickstart.ipynb) to put data into GraphRAG, build indexes, and run queries.
